# This is base migration directory.
#
# There are two subdirectories: upgrades, downgrades
# Place all upgrade scripts in upgrades directory
# Place all downgrade scripts in downgrades directory
# Upgrade and downgrade script names should be named for the destination version
# For instance if you want to upgrade to 10.1.0 from 10.0.0, name the upgrade script upgrades/10.1.0_upgrade.sql
# The accompanying downgrade script should be named downgrades/10.0.0_downgrade.sql and should undo the 10.1.0_upgrade.sql operations.
